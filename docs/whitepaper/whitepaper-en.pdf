Galaxy Public Blockchain (GPB) Whitepaper Summary

Galaxy Public Blockchain (GPB) is a distributed infrastructure designed to support cross-chain commercial applications. Initiated by the Galaxy Fund Alliance and developed by a global team of engineers and researchers, GPB provides a foundational platform for token issuance, decentralized finance, and enterprise blockchain adoption.

Key Features:
- Consensus: GPB adopts a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) mechanism with 19 genesis nodes and 199 backup nodes, ensuring efficiency, decentralization, and environmental sustainability.
- Governance: Transparent distributed governance through community voting, node replacement, and democratic oversight.
- Technology: GPB integrates GVM (Galaxy Virtual Machine) for multi-language smart contract development, supports cross-chain interoperability with ETH, BSC, TRON, COSMOS, and Polkadot, and achieves high throughput (TPS > 13,000).
- Applications: GPB enables decentralized asset trading, privacy-preserving computation, DeFi services, big data exchange, and atomic cross-chain transactions.
- Architecture: A layered system including consensus, runtime environment, cross-chain bridges, off-chain smart contracts, and data collaboration modules.
- Tokenomics: Total supply of 21 million GPB, with 10% initial distribution and 90% generated via staking and mining rewards. Voting and staking mechanisms reduce circulating supply and enhance network security.
- Use Cases: GPB supports product traceability, supply chain optimization, decentralized finance, enterprise blockchain transformation, and digital credit systems.
